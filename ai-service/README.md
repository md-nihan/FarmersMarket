## Local development

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## Deploying on Render

- Root Directory: ai-service
- Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Start Command: gunicorn -w 1 -b 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app
- Python version: Render may default to Python 3.13; wheels are pinned to support it. If you must pin, use runtime.txt (python-3.13.0).

Troubleshooting:
- If build fails on Pillow with source build logs, ensure you're using a Pillow version with wheels for your Python (we pin to 11.0.0 which has Py3.13 wheels).
- If Render ignores runtime.txt and still uses Py3.13, this config will still succeed.
