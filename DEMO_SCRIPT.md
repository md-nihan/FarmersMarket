## 📝 Talking Points

### Opening Hook:
> "Imagine a farmer who grows tomatoes but earns only ₹10 per kg because of middlemen, while you pay ₹40 per kg at the store. What if we could connect them directly?"

### Problem Emphasis:
> "Today, a farmer in Bengaluru has no idea what a restaurant 5 km away needs. And that restaurant has no idea that fresh produce is available next door. We're solving this hyperlocal disconnect."

### AI Differentiation:
> "Unlike traditional marketplaces, we use AI to solve the trust problem. Buyers don't need to physically inspect produce—our neural network does it automatically and transparently."

### WhatsApp Strategy:
> "In India, 500 million people use WhatsApp. Farmers are already on it. We meet them where they are, instead of asking them to learn a new app."

### Closing Impact:
> "FarmLink AI isn't just a platform—it's a movement to empower farmers, reduce food waste, and build sustainable local economies. Join us in revolutionizing India's agricultural supply chain."
