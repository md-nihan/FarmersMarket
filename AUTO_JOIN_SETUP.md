2. Fill form:
   - Name: Ramesh Kumar
   - Phone: +919876543210

```

### Step 2: System Automatically Sends WhatsApp

To: +919876543210 (Farmer's number)

Message:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🌾 Welcome to FarmLink AI!

Hi Ramesh Kumar! 👋

To start listing your vegetables, please reply to this message with:

```

### Step 3: Farmer Replies (One Time Only)
```
Farmer sends WhatsApp:
